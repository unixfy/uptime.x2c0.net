X2C0 Uptime
---

[![CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/unixfy/uptime.x2c0.net.svg?style=svg)](https://circleci.com/gh/unixfy/uptime.x2c0.net)

This is built specifically as a status page for X2C0.NET services, with UptimeRobot as a backend.

I used portions of code from [CoolQ](https://github.com/CoolQ/status) to build this project.
